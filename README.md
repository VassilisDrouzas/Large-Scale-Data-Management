In this subject, we made two projects in Ubuntu (with the assistance of a Vagrant file):

1) **Java Hadoop Map-Reduce Application**:
   
   - Calculates the frequency of each word in a large file.
   - Aggregates Spotify song statistics by country and month.

2) **Hadoop SPARK-Cassandra Application**:

   - Generates a customizable stream of test data and sends it to a Kafka cluster.
   - Reads and preprocesses the streaming data, merging it with static data using Apache SPARK.
   - Regularly uploads the processed data to a Cassandra cluster.
   - Executes queries on the Cassandra cluster using CQL.
